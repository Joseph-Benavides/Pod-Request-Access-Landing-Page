## My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- JavaScript
- DOM
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I Learned

With this project I was able to work on the moblie-first workflow and further adjust the code to fit across all devices to deliver a great responsive web product/services. I was able to work on JavaScript and the DOM to create an interactive component.

### Continued Development

On future projects I will focus on using JavaScript and the DOM to create more complex interactive sites. I will also continue to refine my responsive web design skills in order to execute it in a quicker manner.
